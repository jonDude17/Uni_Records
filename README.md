University Records DApp
Welcome to the University Records DApp repository! This decentralized application (DApp) is designed to provide students with a secure and efficient means of accessing their school records using a unique key, in this case, their date of birth.

Overview
This DApp leverages blockchain technology to enhance the security and transparency of university records. By using a decentralized and tamper-resistant ledger, students can trust that their academic information remains secure and unaltered. The unique key, the date of birth in this instance, serves as a secure authentication method, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access the records.

Features
Decentralized Access: The DApp eliminates the need for a centralized authority to manage and verify student records. Instead, the blockchain ensures a trustless and transparent system.

Secure Authentication: The use of a unique key, the date of birth, ensures secure authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

Immutable Records: Once information is recorded on the blockchain, it becomes tamper-resistant. This immutability guarantees the integrity of student records.
